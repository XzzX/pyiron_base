# Tutorial 
The motivation for the `pyiron_base` workflow manager is to provide a self-consistent environment for the development
of simulation protocols. Many `pyiron_base` users previously used the command line to manage their simulation protocols
and construct parameter studies. Still based on the limitations in coupling command line approaches to machine learning 
models, `pyiron_base` is based on the Python programming language, and it is recommended to use the `pyiro_base` workflow
manager in combination with Jupyter Lab for maximum efficiency. Consequently, the first challenge is guiding users who 
used the command line before and now switch to using only Jupyter notebooks. 

The three most fundamental objects to learn when interacting with the `pyiron_base` workflow manager are jupyter notebooks,
`pyiron_base` Project objects and `pyiron_base` Job objects. These are introduced below.
